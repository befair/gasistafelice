This decorator uses the hotshot profiler to profile some callable (like
a view function or method) and dumps the profile data for later processing 
and examination.

It takes one argument, the profile log name, which is joined to the end 
of the path 'gasistafelice/profiling_logs' (this absolute path is, however,  
defined by PROFILE_LOG_BASE in settings.py. 
It also inserts a time stamp into the file name, such that 'my_view.prof' 
become 'my_view-20100211T170321.prof',where the time stamp is in UTC. 
This makes it easy to run and compare multiple trials.
